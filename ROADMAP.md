## Version 2.0.0 (beta) – Beta Upgrade ![Planned](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Planned-red)
- **Status**: Planned
- **Expected Release Date**: [TBD]
- **Features**:
  - **Revamped frontend**: Our focus is on redesigning the main interface, login portal, account registration, and password reset functionalities to a more robust and user friendly frontend. As of now, we're committed to using `Next.js` as our frontend framework. However, we're evaluating whether to continue with Netlify—which includes Netlify Functions and Identity—or transition our identity management, hosting, and deployment to Vercel. AWS services (Lambda, API Gateway etc.) will remain part of our tech stack for the foreseeable future.
